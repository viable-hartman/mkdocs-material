However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few small tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just CSS and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Additional JavaScript \u00b6 If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir setting: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir setting is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name setting in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics.html # - Google Analytics \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 disqus.html # - Disqus \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-file.html # Source file information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html partial, create a new footer.html partial in the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks recommended \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks, which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. In order to set up block overrides, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following lines to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} The following template blocks are provided by the theme: Block name Purpose analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the Disqus integration extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) outdated Wraps the version warning scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the style sheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) Additional variables \u00b6 Besides template blocks, Material for MkDocs provides extra variables for parts that cannot be overridden with template blocks (due to technical limitations of the template engine). If you want to add further information after the Made with Material for MkDocs hint in the footer, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% set extracopyright %} <!-- Add additional copyright information here --> {% endset %} The following template variables are provided by the theme: Block name Purpose extracopyright Adds custom copyright information Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs is built on top of TypeScript , RxJS and SASS , and uses a lean, custom build process to put everything together. 1 If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 14 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the watcher with: npm start Then, in a second terminal window, start the MkDocs live preview server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this very documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overwritten when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all style sheets and JavaScript files. After the command exits, the compiled files are located in the material directory. When running mkdocs build , you should now see your changes to the original theme. Prior to 7.0.0 the build was based on Webpack, resulting in occasional broken builds due to incompatibilities with loaders and plugins. Therefore, we decided to swap Webpack for a leaner solution which is now based on RxJS as the application itself. This allowed for the pruning of more than 500 dependencies (~30% less). \u21a9","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and Material for MkDocs is a great starting point for making it look beautiful.

At the root of your repository, create a new GitHub Actions workflow, e.g. .github/workflows/ci.yml , and copy and paste the following contents: Material for MkDocs Insiders name : ci # (1) on : push : branches : # (2) - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - run : pip install mkdocs-material # (3) - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force You can change the name to your liking. At some point, GitHub renamed master to main . If your default branch is named master , you can safely remove main , vice versa. This is the place to install further MkDocs plugins or Markdown extensions with pip to be used during the build: pip install \\ mkdocs-material \\ mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin \\ ... name : ci on : push : branches : - master - main jobs : deploy : runs-on : ubuntu-latest if : github.event.repository.fork == false steps : - uses : actions/checkout@v2 - uses : actions/setup-python@v2 with : python-version : 3.x - run : pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git - run : mkdocs gh-deploy --force env : GH_TOKEN : ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} # (1) Remember to set the GH_TOKEN environment variable to the value of your personal access token when deploying Insiders , which can be done using GitHub secrets . Now, when a new commit is pushed to either the master or main branches, the static site is automatically built and deployed. Push your changes to see the workflow in action. Your documentation should shortly appear at <username>.github.io/<repository> . with MkDocs \u00b6 If you prefer to deploy your project documentation manually, you can just invoke the following command from the directory containing the mkdocs.yml file: mkdocs gh-deploy --force GitLab Pages \u00b6 If you're hosting your code on GitLab, deploying to GitLab Pages can be done by using the GitLab CI task runner.

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material for MkDocs with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px .

Martin Donath \u00b7 @squidfunk September 26, 2021 \u00b7 5 min read \u00b7 7.3.0+insiders-3.1.1 Two weeks ago, Material for MkDocs Insiders shipped a brand new search plugin , yielding massive improvements in usability , but also in speed and size of the search index. Interestingly, as discussed in the previous blog article, we only scratched the surface of what's now possible. This release brings some useful features that enhance the writing experience, allowing for more fine-grained control of what pages, sections and blocks of a Markdown file should be indexed by the built-in search functionality. The following section discusses existing solutions for excluding pages and sections from the search index. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Prior art \u00b6 MkDocs has a rich and thriving ecosystem of plugins , and it comes as no surprise that there's already a fantastic plugin by @chrieke to exclude specific sections of a Markdown file \u2013 the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin. It can be installed with: pip install mkdocs-exclude-search How it works : the plugin post-processes the search_index.json file that is generated by the built-in search plugin, giving the author the ability to exclude certain pages and sections by adding a few lines of configuration to mkdocs.yml . An example: plugins : - search - exclude-search : exclude : - page.md - page.md#section - directory/* - /*/page.md It's easy to see that the plugin follows a configuration-centric approach, which adds support for advanced filtering techniques like infix- and suffix-filtering using wildcards. While this is a very powerful idea, it comes with some downsides: Exclusion patterns and content are not co-located : exclusion patterns need to be defined in mkdocs.yml , and not as part of the respective document or section to be excluded. This might result in stale exclusion patterns, leading to unintended behavior: When a headline is changed, its slug (permalink) also changes, which might suddenly match (or unmatch) a pattern, e.g., when an author fixes a typo in a headline. As exclusion patterns support the use of wildcards, different authors might overwrite each other's patterns without any immediate feedback since the plugin does only report the number of excluded documents \u2013 not what has been excluded. 1 Exclusion control might be too coarse : The mkdocs-exclude-search plugin only allows for the exclusion of pages and sections. It's not possible to exclude parts of a section, e.g., content that is irrelevant to search but must be included as part of the documentation. What's new? \u00b6 The latest Insiders release brings fine-grained control for excluding pages, sections, and blocks from the search index, implemented through front matter, as well as the Attribute Lists . Note that it doesn't replace the mkdocs-exclude-search plugin but complements it. Excluding pages \u00b6 An entire page can be excluded from the search index by adding a simple directive to the front matter of the respective Markdown file. The good thing is that the author now only has to check the top of the document to learn whether it is excluded or not: --- search: exclude: true --- # Document title ... Excluding sections \u00b6 If a section should be excluded, the author can use the Attribute Lists extension to add a pragma called { data-search-exclude } at the end of a heading. The pragma is not included in the final HTML, as search pragmas are filtered by the search plugin before the page is rendered: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title ## Section 1 The content of this section is included ## Section 2 { data-search-exclude } The content of this section is excluded { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#section-1\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this section is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Section 1\" } ] } Excluding blocks \u00b6 If even more fine-grained control is desired, the pragma can be added to any block-level element or inline-level element that is officially supported by the Attribute Lists extension: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title The content of this block is included The content of this block is excluded { data-search-exclude } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this block is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, ] } Conclusion \u00b6 The latest release brings three simple ways to control more precisely what goes into the search index and what doesn't. It complements the already very powerful mkdocs-exclude-search plugin, allowing for new methods of shaping the structure, size and content of the search index. When the log level is set to DEBUG , the plugin will report exactly which pages and sections have been excluded from the search index, but MkDocs will now flood the terminal with debug output from its core and other plugins. \u21a9","title":"Excluding content from search"},{"location":"blog/2021/excluding-content-from-search/#excluding-content-from-search","text":"The latest Insiders release brings three new simple ways to exclude dedicated parts of a document from the search index, allowing for more fine-grained control.

Martin Donath \u00b7 @squidfunk September 13, 2021 \u00b7 15 min read \u00b7 7.2.6+insiders-3.0.0 The search of Material for MkDocs is by far one of its best and most-loved assets: multilingual , offline-capable , and most importantly: all client-side . It provides a solution to empower the users of your documentation to find what they're searching for instantly without the headache of managing additional servers. However, even though several iterations have been made, there's still some room for improvement, which is why we rebuilt the search plugin and integration from the ground up. This article shines some light on the internals of the new search, why it's much more powerful than the previous version, and what's about to come. The next section discusses the architecture and issues of the current search implementation. If you immediately want to learn what's new, skip to the section just after that . Architecture \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses lunr together with lunr-languages to implement its client-side search capabilities. When a documentation page is loaded and JavaScript is available, the search index as generated by the built-in search plugin during the build process is requested from the server: const index$ = document . forms . namedItem ( \"search\" ) ? __search ? . index || requestJSON < SearchIndex > ( new URL ( \"search/search_index.json\" , config . base ) ) : NEVER Search index \u00b6 The search index includes a stripped-down version of all pages. Let's take a look at an example to understand precisely what the search index contains from the original Markdown file: Expand to inspect example docs/page.md search_index.json # Example ## Text It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even add [ links ]( # ), or even `code` : ``` if (isAwesome) { return true } ``` ## Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: 1. One 2. Two 3. Three Sometimes you want bullet points: * Start a line with a star * Profit! { \"config\" : { \"indexing\" : \"full\" , \"lang\" : [ \"en\" ], \"min_search_length\" : 3 , \"prebuild_index\" : false , \"separator\" : \"[\\\\s\\\\-]+\" }, \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index, we immediately see several problems: All content is included twice : the search index contains one entry with the entire contents of the page, and one entry for each section of the page, i.e., each block preceded by a headline or subheadline. This significantly contributes to the size of the search index. All structure is lost : when the search index is built, all structural information like HTML tags and attributes are stripped from the content. While this approach works well for paragraphs and inline formatting, it might be problematic for lists and code blocks. An excerpt: \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } Lists Sometimes you want \u2026 Context : for an untrained eye, the result can look like gibberish, as it's not immediately apparent what classifies as text and what as code. Furthermore, it's not clear that Lists is a headline as it's merged with the code block before and the paragraph after it. Punctuation : inline elements like links that are immediately followed by punctuation are separated by whitespace (see , and : in the excerpt). This is because all extracted text is joined with a whitespace character during the construction of the search index. It's not difficult to see that it can be quite challenging to implement a good search experience for theme authors, which is why Material for MkDocs (up to now) did some monkey patching to be able to render slightly more meaningful search previews. Search worker \u00b6 The actual search functionality is implemented as part of a web worker 1 , which creates and manages the lunr search index. When search is initialized, the following steps are taken: Linking sections with pages : The search index is parsed, and each section is linked to its parent page. The parent page itself is not indexed , as it would lead to duplicate results, so only the sections remain. Linking is necessary, as search results are grouped by page. Tokenization : The title and text values of each section are split into tokens by using the separator as configured in mkdocs.yml . Tokenization itself is carried out by lunr's default tokenizer , which doesn't allow for lookahead or separators spanning multiple characters. Why is this important and a big deal? We will see later how much more we can achieve with a tokenizer that is capable of separating strings with lookahead. Indexing : As a final step, each section is indexed. When querying the index, if a search query includes one of the tokens as returned by step 2., the section is considered to be part of the search result and passed to the main thread. Now, that's basically how the search worker operates. Sure, there's a little more magic involved, e.g., search results are post-processed and rescored to account for some shortcomings of lunr , but in general, this is how data gets into and out of the index. Search previews \u00b6 Users should be able to quickly scan and evaluate the relevance of a search result in the given context, which is why a concise summary with highlighted occurrences of the search terms found is an essential part of a great search experience. This is where the current search preview generation falls short, as some of the search previews appear not to include any occurrence of any of the search terms. This was due to the fact that search previews were truncated after a maximum of 320 characters , as can be seen here: The first two results look like they're not relevant, as they don't seem to include the query string the user just searched for. Yet, they are. A better solution to this problem has been on the roadmap for a very, very long time, but in order to solve this once and for all, several factors need to be carefully considered: Word boundaries : some themes 2 for static site generators generate search previews by expanding the text left and right next to an occurrence, stopping at a whitespace character when enough words have been consumed. A preview might look like this: \u2026 channels, e.g., or which can be configured via mkdocs.yml \u2026 While this may work for languages that use whitespace as a separator between words, it breaks down for languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 , as they have non-whitespace word boundaries and use dedicated segmenters to split strings into tokens. Context-awareness : Although whitespace doesn't work for all languages, one could argue that it could be a good enough solution. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true for code blocks, as the removal of whitespace might change meaning in some languages. Structure : Preserving structural information is not a must, but apparently beneficial to build more meaningful search previews which allow for a quick evaluation of relevance. If a word occurrence is part of a code block, it should be rendered as a code block. What's new? \u00b6 After we built a solid understanding of the problem space and before we dive into the internals of our new search implementation to see which of the problems it already solves, a quick overview of what features and improvements it brings: Better : support for rich search previews , preserving the structural information of code blocks, inline code, and lists, so they are rendered as-is, as well as lookahead tokenization , more accurate highlighting , and improved stability of typeahead. Also, a slightly better UX . Faster and smaller : significant decrease in search index size of up to 48% due to improved extraction and construction techniques, resulting in a search experience that is up to 95% faster, which is particularly helpful for large documentation projects. Rich search previews \u00b6 As we rebuilt the search plugin from scratch, we reworked the construction of the search index to preserve the structural information of code blocks, inline code, as well as unordered and ordered lists. Using the example from the search index section, here's how it looks: Now Before Now, code blocks are first-class citizens of search previews , and even inline code formatting is preserved. Let's take a look at the new structure of the search index to understand why: Expand to inspect search index Now Before { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"<p>It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links, or even <code>code</code>:</p> <pre><code>if (isAwesome){\\n return true\\n}\\n</code></pre>\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"<p>Sometimes you want numbered lists:</p> <ol> <li>One</li> <li>Two</li> <li>Three</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes you want bullet points:</p> <ul> <li>Start a line with a star</li> <li>Profit!</li> </ul>\" } ] } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true }\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" } ] } If we inspect the search index again, we can see how the situation improved: Content is included only once : the search index does not include the content of the page twice, as only the sections of a page are part of the search index. This leads to a significant reduction in size, fewer bytes to transfer, and a smaller search index. Some structure is preserved : each section of the search index includes a small subset of HTML to provide the necessary structure to allow for more sophisticated search previews. Revisiting our example from before, let's look at an excerpt: Now Before \u2026 links, or even < code > code </ code > : </ p > < pre >< code > if (isAwesome){ \u2026 }\\n </ code ></ pre > \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } The punctuation issue is gone, as no additional whitespace is inserted, and the preserved markup yields additional context to make scanning search results more effective. On to the next step in the process: tokenization . Tokenizer lookahead \u00b6 The default tokenizer of lunr uses a regular expression to split a given string by matching each character against the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml . This doesn't allow for more complex separators based on lookahead or multiple characters. Fortunately, our new search implementation provides an advanced tokenizer that doesn't have these shortcomings and supports more complex regular expressions. As a result, Material for MkDocs just changed its own separator configuration to the following value: [\\s\\-,:!=\\[\\]()\"/]+|(?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z])|\\.(?!\\d)|&[lg]t; While the first part up to the first | contains a list of single control characters at which the string should be split, the following three sections explain the remainder of the regular expression. 4 Case changes \u00b6 Many programming languages use PascalCase or camelCase naming conventions. When a user searches for the term case , it's quite natural to expect for PascalCase and camelCase to show up. By adding the following match group to the separator, this can now be achieved with ease: (?!\\b)(?=[A-Z][a-z]) This regular expression is a combination of a negative lookahead ( \\b , i.e., not a word boundary) and a positive lookahead ( [A-Z][a-z] , i.e., an uppercase character followed by a lowercase character), and has the following behavior: PascalCase Pascal , Case camelCase camel , Case UPPERCASE UPPERCASE Searching for searchHighlight now brings up the section discussing the search.highlight feature flag, which also demonstrates that this now even works properly for search queries. 5 Version numbers \u00b6 Indexing version numbers is another problem that can be solved with a small lookahead. Usually, . should be considered a separator to split words like search.highlight . However, splitting version numbers at . will make them undiscoverable. Thus, the following expression: \\.(?!\\d) This regular expression matches a . only if not immediately followed by a digit \\d , which leaves version numbers discoverable. Searching for 7.2.6 brings up the 7.2.6 release notes. HTML/XML tags \u00b6 If your documentation includes HTML/XML code examples, you may want to allow users to find specific tag names. Unfortunately, the < and > control characters are encoded in code blocks as &lt; and &gt; . Now, adding the following expression to the separator allows for just that: &[lg]t; Searching for custom search worker script brings up the section on custom search and matches the script tag among the other search terms discovered. We've only just begun to scratch the surface of the new possibilities tokenizer lookahead brings. If you found other useful expressions, you're invited to share them in the comment section. Accurate highlighting \u00b6 Highlighting is the last step in the process of search and involves the highlighting of all search term occurrences in a given search result. For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists. Now, only the content blocks that actually contain occurrences of one of the search terms are considered for inclusion into the search preview. If a term only occurs in a code block, it's the code block that gets rendered, see, for example, the results of twitter . Benchmarks \u00b6 We conducted two benchmarks \u2013 one with the documentation of Material for MkDocs itself, and one with a very massive corpus of Markdown files with more than 800,000 words \u2013 a size most documentation projects will likely never reach: Before Now Relative Material for MkDocs Index size 573 kB 335 kB \u201342% Index size ( gzip ) 105 kB 78 kB \u201327% Indexing time 7 265 ms 177 ms \u201334% KJV Markdown 8 Index size 8.2 MB 4.4 MB \u201347% Index size ( gzip ) 2.3 MB 1.2 MB \u201348% Indexing time 2,700 ms 1,390 ms \u201348% Benchmark results The results show that indexing time, which is the time that it takes to set up the search when the page is loaded, has dropped by up to 48%, which means the new search is up to 95% faster . This is a significant improvement, particularly relevant for large documentation projects. While 1,3s still may sound like a long time, using the new client-side search together with instant loading only creates the search index on the initial page load. When navigating, the search index is preserved across pages, so the cost does only have to be paid once. User interface \u00b6 Additionally, some small improvements have been made, most prominently the more results on this page button, which now sticks to the top of the search result list when open. This enables the user to jump out of the list more quickly. What's next? \u00b6 Our new search implementation is a big improvement to Material for MkDocs. It solves some long-standing issues which needed to be tackled for years. Yet, it's only the start of a search experience that is going to get better and better. Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. 9 Prior to 5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in 5.0.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9 We've disabled comments due to Disqus' ads being so incredibly horrible and invasive.

Punctuation : inline elements like links that are immediately followed by punctuation are separated by whitespace (see , and : in the excerpt). This is because all extracted text is joined with a whitespace character during the construction of the search index. It's not difficult to see that it can be quite challenging to implement a good search experience for theme authors, which is why Material for MkDocs (up to now) did some monkey patching to be able to render slightly more meaningful search previews.","title":"Search index"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#search-worker","text":"The actual search functionality is implemented as part of a web worker 1 , which creates and manages the lunr search index. When search is initialized, the following steps are taken: Linking sections with pages : The search index is parsed, and each section is linked to its parent page. The parent page itself is not indexed , as it would lead to duplicate results, so only the sections remain. Linking is necessary, as search results are grouped by page. Tokenization : The title and text values of each section are split into tokens by using the separator as configured in mkdocs.yml . Tokenization itself is carried out by lunr's default tokenizer , which doesn't allow for lookahead or separators spanning multiple characters. Why is this important and a big deal? We will see later how much more we can achieve with a tokenizer that is capable of separating strings with lookahead. Indexing : As a final step, each section is indexed. When querying the index, if a search query includes one of the tokens as returned by step 2., the section is considered to be part of the search result and passed to the main thread. Now, that's basically how the search worker operates. Sure, there's a little more magic involved, e.g., search results are post-processed and rescored to account for some shortcomings of lunr , but in general, this is how data gets into and out of the index.","title":"Search worker"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#search-previews","text":"Users should be able to quickly scan and evaluate the relevance of a search result in the given context, which is why a concise summary with highlighted occurrences of the search terms found is an essential part of a great search experience. This is where the current search preview generation falls short, as some of the search previews appear not to include any occurrence of any of the search terms. This was due to the fact that search previews were truncated after a maximum of 320 characters , as can be seen here: The first two results look like they're not relevant, as they don't seem to include the query string the user just searched for. Yet, they are. A better solution to this problem has been on the roadmap for a very, very long time, but in order to solve this once and for all, several factors need to be carefully considered: Word boundaries : some themes 2 for static site generators generate search previews by expanding the text left and right next to an occurrence, stopping at a whitespace character when enough words have been consumed. A preview might look like this: \u2026 channels, e.g., or which can be configured via mkdocs.yml \u2026 While this may work for languages that use whitespace as a separator between words, it breaks down for languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 , as they have non-whitespace word boundaries and use dedicated segmenters to split strings into tokens. Context-awareness : Although whitespace doesn't work for all languages, one could argue that it could be a good enough solution. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true for code blocks, as the removal of whitespace might change meaning in some languages. Structure : Preserving structural information is not a must, but apparently beneficial to build more meaningful search previews which allow for a quick evaluation of relevance. If a word occurrence is part of a code block, it should be rendered as a code block.","title":"Search previews"},{"location":"blog/2021/search-better-faster-smaller/#whats-new","text":"After we built a solid understanding of the problem space and before we dive into the internals of our new search implementation to see which of the problems it already solves, a quick overview of what features and improvements it brings: Better : support for rich search previews , preserving the structural information of code blocks, inline code, and lists, so they are rendered as-is, as well as lookahead tokenization , more accurate highlighting , and improved stability of typeahead. Also, a slightly better UX .

Using the example from the search index section, here's how it looks: Now Before Now, code blocks are first-class citizens of search previews , and even inline code formatting is preserved. Let's take a look at the new structure of the search index to understand why: Expand to inspect search index Now Before { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"<p>It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links, or even <code>code</code>:</p> <pre><code>if (isAwesome){\\n return true\\n}\\n</code></pre>\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#lists\" , \"title\" : \"Lists\" , \"text\" : \"<p>Sometimes you want numbered lists:</p> <ol> <li>One</li> <li>Two</li> <li>Three</li> </ol> <p>Sometimes you want bullet points:</p> <ul> <li>Start a line with a star</li> <li>Profit!</li> </ul>\" } ] } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"Example Text It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown. You can even add links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { return true } Lists Sometimes you want numbered lists: One Two Three Sometimes you want bullet points: Start a line with a star Profit!\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#example\" , \"title\" : \"Example\" , \"text\" : \"\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#text\" , \"title\" : \"Text\" , \"text\" : \"It's very easy to make some words bold and other words italic with Markdown.

This leads to a significant reduction in size, fewer bytes to transfer, and a smaller search index. Some structure is preserved : each section of the search index includes a small subset of HTML to provide the necessary structure to allow for more sophisticated search previews. Revisiting our example from before, let's look at an excerpt: Now Before \u2026 links, or even < code > code </ code > : </ p > < pre >< code > if (isAwesome){ \u2026 }\\n </ code ></ pre > \u2026 links , or even code : if (isAwesome) { \u2026 } The punctuation issue is gone, as no additional whitespace is inserted, and the preserved markup yields additional context to make scanning search results more effective.

For a long time, highlighting was implemented through dynamically generated regular expressions . 6 This approach has some problems with non-whitespace languages like Japanese or Chinese 3 since it only works if the highlighted term is at a word boundary. However, Asian languages are tokenized using a dedicated segmenter , which cannot be modeled with regular expressions. Now, as a direct result of the new tokenization approach , our new search implementation uses token positions for highlighting , making it exactly as powerful as tokenization: Word boundaries : as the new highlighter uses token positions, word boundaries are equal to token boundaries. This means that more complex cases of tokenization (e.g., case changes , version numbers , HTML/XML tags ), are now all highlighted accurately. Context-awareness : as the new search index preserves some of the structural information of the original document, the content of a section is now divided into separate content blocks \u2013 paragraphs, code blocks, and lists.

Next up: Context-aware search summarization : currently, the first two matching content blocks are rendered as a search preview. With the new tokenization technique, we laid the groundwork for more sophisticated shortening and summarization methods, which we're tackling next. User interface improvements : as we now gained full control over the search plugin, we can now add meaningful metadata to provide more context and a better experience. We'll explore some of those paths in the future. If you've made it this far, thank you for your time and interest in Material for MkDocs! This is the first blog article that I decided to write after a short Twitter survey made me to. You're invited to leave a comment to share your experiences with the new search implementation. 9 Prior to 5.0.0, search was carried out in the main thread which locked up the browser, rendering it unusable. This problem was first reported in #904 and, after some back and forth, fixed and released in 5.0.0. \u21a9 At the time of writing, Just the Docs and Docusaurus use this method for generating search previews. Note that the latter also integrates with Algolia, which is a fully managed server-based solution. \u21a9 China and Japan are both within the top 5 countries of origin of users of Material for MkDocs. \u21a9 \u21a9 As a fun fact: the separator default value of the search plugin being [\\s\\-]+ always has been kind of irritating, as it suggests that multiple characters can be considered being a separator. However, the + is completely irrelevant, as regular expression groups involving multiple characters were never supported by lunr's default tokenizer . \u21a9 Previously, the search query was not correctly tokenized due to the way lunr treats wildcards, as it disables the pipeline for search terms that contain wildcards. In order to provide a good typeahead experience, Material for MkDocs adds wildcards to the end of each search term not explicitly preceded with + or - , effectively disabling tokenization. \u21a9 Using the separator as defined in mkdocs.yml , a regular expression was constructed that was trying to mimic the tokenizer. As an example, the search query search highlight was transformed into the rather cumbersome regular expression (^|<separator>)(search|highlight) , which only matches at word boundaries. \u21a9 Smallest value of ten distinct runs. \u21a9 We agnostically use KJV Markdown as a tool for testing to learn how Material for MkDocs behaves on large corpora, as it's a very large set of Markdown files with over 800k words. \u21a9 We've disabled comments due to Disqus' ads being so incredibly horrible and invasive.

strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders . Read on to learn how sponsorship works , and how easy it is to get access to Insiders . The official documentation is built with Insiders squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material How sponsorship works \u00b6 New features first land in Insiders, so eligible sponsors have immediate access . Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general availability. Bugfixes are always released simultaneously in both editions. 1 Don't want to sponsor? No problem, Material for MkDocs already has tons of features available, so chances are that most of your requirements are already satisfied. See the list of exclusive features to learn which features are currently only available to sponsors. How to become a sponsor \u00b6 You can become an eligible sponsor with your individual or organization's GitHub account. Visit squidfunk's sponsor profile , pick any tier from $10/month 2 , and complete the checkout. Then, after a few hours, @squidfunk will add you as a collaborator to the super-secret private GitHub repositority containing the Insiders edition, which contains all brand new and exclusive features . Important : If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your organization and the account that should be added as a collaborator. 3 You can cancel your sponsorship anytime. 4 Join our awesome sponsors Special thanks to our premium sponsors : If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for Material for MkDocs. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards. Exclusive features \u00b6 The following features are currently exclusively available to sponsors: Brand new search plugin Rich search previews Tokenizer with lookahead Advanced search highlighting Excluding content from search Social cards Cookie consent Linking content tabs Boosting pages in search Tags (with search integration) Stay on page when switching versions Version warning Custom admonition icons Code annotations Anchor tracking Mermaid.js integration New features are added to this list every few weeks, so be sure to come back from time to time to learn about what's new, or follow @squidfunk on Twitter to stay updated. Funding \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 Following is a list of funding goals. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released to the public for general availability. $ 4,000 \u2013 Ghost Pepper \u00b6 Anchor tracking Code annotations Version warning $ 5,000 \u2013 Aji Panca \u00b6 Mermaid.js integration Stay on page when switching versions Tags (with search integration) $ 6,000 \u2013 Trinidad Scorpion \u00b6 Boosting pages in search Custom admonition icons Linking content tabs $ 7,000 \u2013 Royal Gold \u00b6 Cookie consent Was this page helpful?

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Payment \u00b6 We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at sponsors@squidfunk.com . Note that one-time payments are not eligible for Insiders, but of course, very appreciated. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 Note that $10/month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. If you sponsor with a lower amount, it's still very much appreciated, but you won't be granted access to Insiders. Custom amounts of $10+ are also eligible. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring.

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users.","title":"Compatibility"},{"location":"insiders/#payment","text":"We don't want to pay for sponsorship every month. Are there any other options? Yes. You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle . If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that). If you have any problems or further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at sponsors@squidfunk.com . Note that one-time payments are not eligible for Insiders, but of course, very appreciated.","title":"Payment"},{"location":"insiders/#terms","text":"We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 Note that $10/month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders. If you sponsor with a lower amount, it's still very much appreciated, but you won't be granted access to Insiders. Custom amounts of $10+ are also eligible. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables admonitions, allows to make them collapsible and to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.superfences See additional configuration options: Admonition Details SuperFences Admonition icons \u00b6 Insiders \u00b7 insiders-2.4.0 Each of the supported admonition types has a distinct icon, which can be changed to any icon bundled with the theme, or even a custom icon . Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : icon : admonition : <type> : <icon> # (1) Set <type > to any of the supported types and <icon> to any valid icon shortcode, which you can find by using the icon search . Example: using alternative icon sets Octicons FontAwesome Example : theme : icon : admonition : note : octicons/tag-16 abstract : octicons/checklist-16 info : octicons/info-16 tip : octicons/squirrel-16 success : octicons/check-16 question : octicons/question-16 warning : octicons/alert-16 failure : octicons/x-circle-16 danger : octicons/zap-16 bug : octicons/bug-16 example : octicons/beaker-16 quote : octicons/quote-16 Result : Example : theme : icon : admonition : note : fontawesome/solid/sticky-note abstract : fontawesome/solid/book info : fontawesome/solid/info-circle tip : fontawesome/solid/bullhorn success : fontawesome/solid/check question : fontawesome/solid/question-circle warning : fontawesome/solid/exclamation-triangle failure : fontawesome/solid/bomb danger : fontawesome/solid/skull bug : fontawesome/solid/robot example : fontawesome/solid/flask quote : fontawesome/solid/quote-left Result : Usage \u00b6 Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block starts with !!! , followed by a single keyword used as a type qualifier . The content of the block follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier. Example : !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks . Example : !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 When Details is enabled and an admonition block is started with ??? instead of !!! , the admonition is rendered as a collapsible block with a small toggle on the right side. Example : ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after the ??? token will render the block as open. Example : ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 7.0.0 \u00b7 Experimental Admonitions can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. for sidebars), placing them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier. inline end inline Example / Result : Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. !!! info inline end Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline end to align to the right (left for rtl languages). Example / Result : Info Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. !!! info inline Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Use inline to align to the left (right for rtl languages). Important : Admonitions that use the inline modifiers must be declared prior to the content block you want to place them beside. If there's insufficient space to render the admonition next to the block, the admonition will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports.

Material for MkDocs provides different ways to set up syntax highlighting for code blocks, either during build time using Pygments or during runtime using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Configuration \u00b6 This configuration enables syntax highlighting on code blocks and inline code blocks, and allows to include source code directly from other files. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.snippets See additional configuration options: Highlight InlineHilite SuperFences Snippets Code annotations \u00b6 Insiders \u00b7 insiders-2.2.0 \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental Code annotations offer a comfortable and friendly way to attach arbitrary content to specific sections of code blocks by adding numeric markers in block and inline comments in the language of the code block. Add the following to mkdocs.yml to enable them globally: theme : features : - content.code.annotate # (1) I'm a code annotation! I can contain code , formatted text , images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown. Enabling code annotations for a specific code block If you don't want to enable code annotations globally, because you don't like the automatic inlining behavior, you can enable them for a specific code block by using a slightly different syntax based on the Attribute Lists extension: ``` { .yaml .annotate } # Code block content ``` Note that the language shortcode which has to come first must now also be prefixed by a . . Usage \u00b6 This section discusses how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments \u2013 the default highlighter \u2013 so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Specifying the language \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add syntax highlighting to those blocks, add the language shortcode directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the shortcode for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding annotations \u00b6 Code annotations can be placed anywhere in a code block where a comment for the language of the block can be placed, e.g. for JavaScript in // ... and /* ... */ , for YAML in # ... , etc. 1 Example : ``` yaml theme: features: - content.code.annotate # (1) ``` 1. :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code` , __formatted text__, images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown. Result : theme : features : - content.code.annotate # (1) I'm a code annotation! I can contain code , formatted text , images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown. Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the shortcode, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows to split large code blocks for readability. Example : ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language shortcode. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums . Line numbers Line number ranges Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2-5\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code blocks \u00b6 When InlineHilite is enabled, syntax highlighting can be applied to inline code blocks by prefixing them with a shebang, i.e. #! , directly followed by the corresponding language shortcode . Example : The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Result : The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Embedding external files \u00b6 When Snippets is enabled, content from other files (including source files) can be embedded by using the --8<-- notation directly from within a code block: Example : ``` --8<--\u200b \".browserslistrc\" ``` Result : last 4 years Customization \u00b6 Custom syntax theme \u00b6 If Pygments is used, Material for MkDocs provides the styles for code blocks , which are built with a custom and well-balanced palette that works equally well for both color schemes : --md-code-hl-number-color --md-code-hl-special-color --md-code-hl-function-color --md-code-hl-constant-color --md-code-hl-keyword-color --md-code-hl-string-color --md-code-hl-name-color --md-code-hl-operator-color --md-code-hl-punctuation-color --md-code-hl-comment-color --md-code-hl-generic-color --md-code-hl-variable-color Code block foreground, background and line highlight colors are defined via: --md-code-fg-color --md-code-bg-color --md-code-hl-color Let's say you want to change the color of \"strings\" . While there are several types of string tokens , they use the same color. You can assign a new color by using an additional style sheet : docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml : root > * { --md-code-hl-string-color : #0FF1CE ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css If you want to tweak a specific type of string, e.g. `backticks` , you can lookup the specific CSS class name in the syntax theme definition , and override it as part of your additional style sheet : docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . highlight . sb { color : #0FF1CE ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Code annotations require syntax highlighting with Pygments \u2013 they're currently not compatible with JavaScript syntax highlighters. Support will be added at a later point, allowing to always place code annotations at the end of lines. \u21a9","title":"Code blocks"},{"location":"reference/code-blocks/#code-blocks","text":"Code blocks and examples are an essential part of technical project documentation.

Usage \u00b6 Using flowcharts \u00b6 Flowcharts are diagrams that represent workflows or processes. The steps are rendered as nodes of various kinds and are connected by edges, describing the necessary order of steps. Example : ``` mermaid graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; ``` Result : graph LR A[Start] --> B{Error?}; B -->|Yes| C[Hmm...]; C --> D[Debug]; D --> B; B ---->|No| E[Yay!]; Using sequence diagrams \u00b6 Sequence diagrams describe a specific scenario as sequential interactions between multiple objects or actors, including the messages that are exchanged between those actors. Example : ``` mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts! John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! ``` Result : sequenceDiagram Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John->>John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts! John-->>Alice: Great! John->>Bob: How about you? Bob-->>John: Jolly good! Using state diagrams \u00b6 State diagrams are a great tool to describe the behavior of a system, decomposing it into a finite number of states, and transitions between those states. Example : ``` mermaid stateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Active state Active { [*] --> NumLockOff NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed -- [*] --> CapsLockOff CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed -- [*] --> ScrollLockOff ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed } ``` Result : stateDiagram-v2 [*] --> Active state Active { [*] --> NumLockOff NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed -- [*] --> CapsLockOff CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed -- [*] --> ScrollLockOff ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed } Using class diagrams \u00b6 Class diagrams are central to object oriented programing, describing the structure of a system by modelling entities as classes and relationships between them. Example : ``` mermaid classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } ``` Result : classDiagram Person <|-- Student Person <|-- Professor Person : +String name Person : +String phoneNumber Person : +String emailAddress Person: +purchaseParkingPass() Address \"1\" <-- \"0..1\" Person:lives at class Student{ +int studentNumber +int averageMark +isEligibleToEnrol() +getSeminarsTaken() } class Professor{ +int salary } class Address{ +String street +String city +String state +int postalCode +String country -validate() +outputAsLabel() } Using entity-relationship diagrams \u00b6 An entity-relationship diagram is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that exist between entities. It describes inter-related things in a specific domain of knowledge. Example : ``` mermaid erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses ``` Result : erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses While all Mermaid.js features should work out-of-the-box, Material for MkDocs will currently only adjust the fonts and colors for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagams, state diagrams and entity relationship diagrams. \u21a9","title":"Diagrams"},{"location":"reference/diagrams/#diagrams","text":"Diagrams help to communicate complex relationships and interconnections between different technical components, and are a great addition to project documentation.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - attr_list - md_in_html See additional configuration options: Attribute Lists Markdown in HTML Usage \u00b6 Image alignment \u00b6 When Attribute Lists is enabled, images can be aligned by adding the respective alignment directions via the align attribute, i.e. align=left or align=right : Left Right Example : ![ Placeholder ]( https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa ){ align=left } Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. Why is there no centered alignment? The align attribute doesn't allow for centered alignment, which is why this option is not supported by Material for MkDocs. 1 Instead, the image captions syntax can be used, as captions are optional. Image captions \u00b6 Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions, but it's always possible to use HTML. Using figure and figcaption , captions can be added to images. Example : < figure markdown > <!-- (1) --> ![Dummy image](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/){ width=\"300\" } < figcaption > Image caption </ figcaption > </ figure > Remember to enable the Markdown in HTML extension.

The main reason is portability \u2013 it's still supported by all browsers and clients, and is very unlikely to be completely removed, as many older websites still use it.

Configuration \u00b6 Color palette \u00b6 Color scheme \u00b6 5.2.0 \u00b7 Default: default Material for MkDocs supports two color schemes: a light mode, which is just called default , and a dark mode, which is called slate . The color scheme can be set via mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : scheme : default Click on a tile to change the color scheme: default slate var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-scheme]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_1 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr }) }) Primary color \u00b6 0.2.0 \u00b7 Default: indigo The primary color is used for the header, the sidebar, text links and several other components.

It can be changed in mkdocs.yml by choosing a valid color name: theme : palette : accent : indigo Click on a tile to change the accent color: .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] > code { background-color: var(--md-code-bg-color); color: var(--md-accent-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_3 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr.replace(\"-\", \" \") }) }) Color palette toggle \u00b6 7.1.0 \u00b7 Default: none It's also possible to offer a list of color palettes to the user, each of which can include a scheme , primary and accent color each. The user can toggle between those color palettes: theme : palette : # (1) - scheme : default toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch-off-outline name : Switch to dark mode - scheme : slate # (2) toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch name : Switch to light mode Note that the theme.palette setting is now defined as a list. With 2 (color schemes) x 21 (primary colors) x 17 (accent color) = 714 combinations, it's impossible to ensure that all configurations provide a good user experience (e.g. yellow on light background ). Make sure that the color combination of your choosing provides enough contrast and tweak CSS variables where necessary. The following properties must be set for each toggle: icon Default: none \u00b7 Required \u2013 This field must point to a valid icon path referencing any icon bundled with the theme , or the build will not succeed. Some popular combinations: + \u2013 material/toggle-switch-off-outline + material/toggle-switch + \u2013 material/weather-sunny + material/weather-night + \u2013 material/eye-outline + material/eye + \u2013 material/lightbulb-outline + material/lightbulb name Default: none \u00b7 Required \u2013 This field is used as the toggle's title attribute and should be set to a discernable name to improve accessibility. It will appear on mouse hover. System preference \u00b6 7.1.0 \u00b7 Default: none In order to automatically set the color palette to the user's system preference, a media query can be set as part of the media field next to the toggle definition in mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : - media : \"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" # (1) scheme : default toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch-off-outline name : Switch to dark mode - media : \"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" # (2) scheme : slate toggle : icon : material/toggle-switch name : Switch to light mode This media query is checked first . It's also the fallback when no media query matches. This media query is checked second . If it doesn't match, the first one is automatically used. When the user first visits your site, the media queries are evaluated in the order of their definition. The first media query that matches selects the default color palette. Customization \u00b6 Custom colors \u00b6 Material for MkDocs implements colors using CSS variables (custom properties). If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand-specific colors), you can add an additional style sheet and tweak the values of the CSS variables. Let's say you're YouTube , and want to set the primary color to your brand's palette. Just add: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml : root { --md-primary-fg-color : #EE0F0F ; --md-primary-fg-color--light : #ECB7B7 ; --md-primary-fg-color--dark : #90030C ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css See the file containing the color definitions for a list of all CSS variables.

There're two modes: search This mode is active when the search is focused . It provides several key bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard: Down , Up : select next / previous result Esc , Tab : close search dialog Enter : follow selected result global This mode is active when search is not focussed and when there's no other focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: docs/javascripts/shortcuts.js mkdocs.yml keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () // (1) } }) The call to key.claim() will execute preventDefault() on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners. extra_javascript : - javascripts/shortcuts.js Content area width \u00b6 The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional style sheet and a few lines of CSS: docs/stylesheets/extra.css mkdocs.yml . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; /* (1) */ } If you want the content area to always stretch to the available screen space, reset max-width with the following CSS: . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Prior to 6.2.0, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries directly refefring to a *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page. This made it impossible to include a top-level page (or external link) as a tab item, as was reported in #1884 and #2072 .

By adding this match group to the separator , words are split at case changes , tokenizing the word PascalCase into Pascal and Case , so both terms can be searched individually. Read more on tokenizing case changes \\.(?!\\d) When . is added to the separator , version numbers would be split into parts, rendering them undiscoverable via search. By adding this match group, a small lookahead is introduced, so version numbers will remain as they are, and can be found through search. Read more on tokenizing version numbers &[lg]t; If your documentation includes HTML/XML code examples, you may want to allow users to find specific tag names. Unfortunately, the < and > control characters are encoded in code blocks as &lt; and &gt; . Adding this expression to the separator allows for just that.

Offline search \u00b6 5.0.0 \u00b7 Plugin If you distribute your documentation as *.html files, the built-in search will not work out-of-the-box due to the restrictions modern browsers impose for security reasons. This can be mitigated with the localsearch plugin in combination with @squidfunk 's iframe-worker polyfill. For setup instructions, refer to the localsearch documentation . Tip When distributing documentation as HTML files to be opened from the file system, you will also want to set use_directory_urls: false in mkdocs.yml to make page links function correctly. Usage \u00b6 Search boosting \u00b6 Insiders \u00b7 insiders-2.8.0 When Metadata is enabled, pages can be boosted in search with custom front matter, which will make them rank higher. Add the following lines at the top of a Markdown file: --- search: boost: 2 # (1) --- # Document title ... When boosting pages, be gentle and start with low values . Search exclusion \u00b6 Insiders \u00b7 insiders-3.1.0 \u00b7 Experimental When Metadata is enabled, pages can be excluded from search with custom front matter, removing them from the index. Add the following lines at the top of a Markdown file: --- search: exclude: true --- # Document title ... Excluding sections \u00b6 When Attribute Lists is enabled, specific sections of pages can be excluded from search by adding the { data-search-exclude } pragma after a Markdown heading: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title ## Section 1 The content of this section is included ## Section 2 { data-search-exclude } The content of this section is excluded { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" }, { \"location\" : \"page/#section-1\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this section is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Section 1\" } ] } Excluding blocks \u00b6 When Attribute Lists is enabled, specific sections of pages can be excluded from search by adding the { data-search-exclude } pragma after a Markdown inline- or block-level element: docs/page.md search_index.json # Document title The content of this block is included The content of this block is excluded { data-search-exclude } { ... \"docs\" : [ { \"location\" : \"page/\" , \"text\" : \"<p>The content of this block is included</p>\" , \"title\" : \"Document title\" } ] } Customization \u00b6 The search implementation of Material for MkDocs is probably its most sophisticated feature, as it tries to balance a great typeahead experience, good performance, accessibility, and a result list that is easy to scan. This is where Material for MkDocs deviates from other themes. The following section explains how search can be customized to tailor it to your needs. Query transformation \u00b6 When a user enters a query into the search box, the query is pre-processed before it is submitted to the search index. Material for MkDocs will apply the following transformations, which can be customized by extending the theme : export function defaultTransform ( query : string ) : string { return query . split ( /\"([^\"]+)\"/g ) /* (1) */ . map (( terms , index ) => index & 1 ? terms . replace ( /^\\b|^(?![^\\x00-\\x7F]|$)|\\s+/g , \" +\" ) : terms ) . join ( \"\" ) . replace ( /\"|(?:^|\\s+)[*+\\-:^~]+(?=\\s+|$)/g , \"\" ) /* (2) */ . trim () /* (3) */ } Search for terms in quotation marks and prepend a + modifier to denote that the resulting document must contain all terms, converting the query to an AND query (as opposed to the default OR behavior). While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right. If you want to switch to the default behavior of the mkdocs and readthedocs themes, both of which don't transform the query prior to submission, or customize the transform function, you can do this by overriding the config block : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { transform : function ( query ) { return query } } </ script > {% endblock %} The transform function will receive the query string as entered by the user and must return the processed query string to be submitted to the search index. Custom search \u00b6 Material for MkDocs implements search as part of a web worker . If you want to switch the web worker with your own implementation, e.g. to submit search to an external service, you can add a custom JavaScript file to the docs directory and override the config block : {% block config %} {{ super() }} < script > var __search = { worker : \"<url>\" } </ script > {% endblock %} Communication with the search worker is implemented using a designated message format using discriminated unions, i.e. through the type property of the message. See the following interface definitions to learn about the message formats: SearchMessage SearchIndex and SearchResult The sequence and direction of messages is rather intuitive: SearchSetupMessage SearchReadyMessage SearchQueryMessage SearchResultMessage","title":"Setting up site search"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-site-search/#setting-up-site-search","text":"Material for MkDocs provides an excellent, client-side search implementation, omitting the need for the integration of third-party services, which might be tricky to integrate to be compliant with data privacy regulations.

While users may expect terms enclosed in quotation marks to map to span queries, i.e. for which order is important, lunr doesn't support them, so the best we can do is to convert the terms to an AND query. Replace control characters which are not located at the beginning of the query or preceded by white space, or are not followed by a non-whitespace character or are at the end of the query string. Furthermore, filter unmatched quotation marks. Trim excess whitespace from left and right.

Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.superfences # (1) Highlight is used by the SuperFences extension to perform syntax highlighting on code blocks, not the other way round, which is why this extension also needs to be enabled. The following configuration options are supported: use_pygments Default: true \u2013 This option allows to control whether highlighting should be carried out during build time using Pygments or in the browser with a JavaScript syntax highlighter: Pygments JavaScript markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : true - pymdownx.superfences markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : use_pygments : false As an example, Highlight.js , a JavaScript syntax highlighter, can be integrated with some additional JavaScript and CSS in mkdocs.yml : docs/javascripts/highlight.js mkdocs.yml document $ . subscribe (() => { hljs . highlightAll () }) extra_javascript : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/highlight.min.js - javascripts/highlight.js extra_css : - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.7.2/styles/default.min.css Note that Highlight.js has no affiliation with the Highlight extension. linenums Default: false \u2013 This option will add line numbers to all code blocks. If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers in the code block reference, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, all of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a table, inline and pymdownx-inline render line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx-inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of either table or pymdownx-inline is recommended. The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Specifying the language Adding line numbers Highlighting specific lines Custom syntax theme InlineHilite \u00b6 5.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension add support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks. It's built on top of the Highlight extension, from which it sources its configuration. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight - pymdownx.inlinehilite The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is the css_class option, which must not be changed. See the InlineHilite documentation for guidance. See reference for usage: Highlighting inline code blocks Keys \u00b6 1.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension adds a simple syntax to allow for the rendering of keyboard keys and combinations, e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del . Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.keys The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. The only exception is the class option, which must not be changed. See the Keys documentation for more information. See reference for usage: Adding keyboard keys SmartSymbols \u00b6 0.1.0 \u00b7 Extension The SmartSymbols extension converts some sequences of characters into their corresponding symbols, e.h. copyright symbols or fractions. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.smartsymbols The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the SmartSymbols documentation for guidance. Snippets \u00b6 0.1.0 \u00b7 Extension The Snippets extension adds the ability to embed content from arbitrary files into a document, including other documents or source files, by using a simple syntax. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.snippets The configuration options of this extension are not specific to Material for MkDocs, as they only impact the Markdown parsing stage. See the Snippets documentation for more information. See reference for usage: Adding a glossary Embedding external files SuperFences \u00b6 0.1.0 \u00b7 Extension \u00b7 Supersedes Fenced Code Blocks The SuperFences extension allows for arbitrary nesting of code and content blocks inside each other, including admonitions, tabs, lists and all other elements. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences The following configuration options are supported: custom_fences Default: none \u2013 This option allows to define a handler for custom fences, e.g. to preserve the definitions of Mermaid.js diagrams to be interpreted in the browser: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences : custom_fences : - name : mermaid class : mermaid format : !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format Note that this will primarily prevent syntax highlighting from being applied. See the reference on diagrams to learn how Mermaid.js is integrated with Material for MkDocs. The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Using flowcharts Using sequence diagrams Using state diagrams Using class diagrams Using entity-relationship diagrams Tabbed \u00b6 5.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The Tabbed extension allows the usage of content tabs, a simple way to group related content and code blocks under accessible tabs. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tabbed : alternate_style : true The following configuration options are supported: alternate_style Default: false \u00b7 7.3.1 \u2013 This option enables the alternate style of content tabs, which has better behavior on mobile viewports , and thus is strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tabbed : alternate_style : true The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Grouping code blocks Grouping other content Embedded content Tasklist \u00b6 1.0.0 \u00b7 Extension The Tasklist extension allows for the usage of GitHub Flavored Markdown inspired task lists , following the same syntactical conventions. Enable it via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true The following configuration options are supported: custom_checkbox Default: false \u00b7 This option toggles the rendering style of checkboxes, replacing native checkbox styles with beautiful icons, and is therefore recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tasklist : custom_checkbox : true clickable_checkbox Default: false \u00b7 This option toggles whether checkboxes are clickable. As the state is not persisted, the use of this option is rather discouraged from a user experience perspective: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.tasklist : clickable_checkbox : true The other configuration options of this extension are not officially supported by Material for MkDocs, which is why they may yield unexpected results. Use them at your own risk. See reference for usage: Using task lists Other libraries like KaTeX are also supported and can be integrated with some additional effort.
